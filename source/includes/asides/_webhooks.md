# Webhooks

You can use webhooks to receive notifications fo a collection of common events, see [the list here](#list-of-available-events).

Once you've created a webhook via the API, any time that matching event is triggered in the customer's TradeGecko account, the endpoint will receive a POST request.

### The Webhook notification

The webhook request you received will include a JSON serialized payload including the
`object_id`, `event`, a `timestamp` and the `resource_url`.

```json--inline
  {
    "object_id": 1234567,
    "event": "fulfillments.create",
    "timestamp": 1546272000,
    "resource_url": "https://api.tradegecko.com/fulfillments/1234567.json"
  }
```

It will also include some specific HTTP headers.

`X-Gecko-Delivery`: A unique identifier for the event, if you have any issues with webhooks, please provide this value when submitting any support ticket.

`X-Gecko-Signature`: A signed signature for verification.

To ensure the request comes from TradeGecko itself and is not being spoofed be sure to verify the
signature agains the payload received.

An example implementation in Ruby is provided.

```ruby--inline
def generate_signature(body)
  digest = OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256')
  Base64.encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(digest, application.secret, body.to_json)).strip
end
```


### Responding to a webhook
When receiving a webhook, the request must complete within a 10-second window, we highly recommending processing the webhooks asynchronously to avoid any problems.

we use the HTTP response code to determine whether a webhook has been received successfully.
If your server responds with between 200 and 399, we assume it has been processed successfully.

A 410 Gone response will automatically delete a webhook.
Anything else will start an exponential retry backoff.

If we receive bad responses for several days in a row, we will send a notice email to the Application developer and eventually disconnect the webhook.
